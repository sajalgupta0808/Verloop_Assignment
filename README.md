# Verloop_Assignment

I have used Django to make this assignment. To run the project please run the command:
1) python3 manage.py runserver (for macOS)
2) Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/weather
3) Enter the API Key, City Name and Output format(XML or JSON) and click on submit button to get results.

Short Description: I have made a django project named "WeatherSite" where I have started an app named "weather".

How does Django Project works?<br>
Django project works by defining models to structure the database, creating views to handle user requests and rendering dynamic content using templates, routing URLs to appropriate views, and using various built-in components for authentication, forms, static files, and more. 
This structured approach makes it easier to build and maintain complex web applications.<br>

some useful locations:<br>
views.py: WeatherSite/weather/views.py<br>
index.html: WeatherSite/weather/templates/weather/index.html<br>
output.html: WeatherSite/weather/templates/weather/output.html<br>
urls.py: WeatherSite/WeatherSite/urls.py<br>
